# ⛳ Sidcup Family Golf - Clone Project

Welcome to my **Sidcup Family Golf Clone** project!  
This is a **beginner-friendly attempt** to recreate the feel and layout of the official Sidcup Family Golf website. While it’s not a pixel-perfect or complete clone, this version reflects my **first hands-on experience** working with modern frontend tools.

## 🚀 Features Implemented 
- ✅ Animated text and transitions  
- ✅ Simple hover effects and navigation bar  
- ✅ Custom fonts and assets used to match original site  
- ✅ Scroll animations with smooth experience
